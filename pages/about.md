<big>The intention of building Tremato.de is to provide a quick access to gene information, and quick links for independent analysis, especially for *Schistosoma mansoni* (that's what I am currently working on).</big> 

<big>The whole site is based main databases (NCBI, UniProt, WormBase or GeneDB) but does not have any complex functions. We mainly focus on basic aspects of a gene/protein, e.g. annotation, length, domains, expression data, etc. For more information we provide quick links to relavent database and engines (e.g. blast, gene tree). We also try to combine the differential expression data from various studies.</big>
